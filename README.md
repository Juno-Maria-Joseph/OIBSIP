Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis on Retail Sales Data
Description: In this project, I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on retail sales data to uncover patterns, trends, and insights that can help inform business decisions.

Key Components: Data loading and cleaning, descriptive statistics, time series analysis, customer and product analysis, and data visualization.
Tools: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Outcome: Provided actionable recommendations for inventory management and targeted marketing.


Task 2: Customer Segmentation Analysis
Description: This project focuses on segmenting customers based on behavior and purchase patterns, using clustering algorithms to help an e-commerce company personalize marketing efforts.

Key Components: Data collection and cleaning, clustering with K-means, visualization, and insights for targeted marketing strategies.
Tools: Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Outcome: Identified distinct customer segments to guide business strategy.


Task 3: Data Cleaning
Description: This task emphasizes the importance of data cleaning to improve data accuracy and reliability, covering fundamental techniques essential for any data professional.

Key Concepts: Data integrity, handling missing values, duplicate removal, standardization, and outlier detection.
Tools: Python, Pandas, Numpy
Outcome: Improved data quality, laying the groundwork for accurate analysis.


Task 4: Predicting House Prices with Linear Regression
Description: Developed a linear regression model to predict house prices, using a dataset with relevant features to train and test the model.

Key Components: Data exploration, feature selection, model training and evaluation, and visualization of predicted vs. actual values.
Tools: Python, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib
Outcome: Gained hands-on experience with linear regression, a fundamental predictive modeling technique.


Task 5: Wine Quality Prediction
Description: Created a model to predict wine quality based on chemical characteristics, applying machine learning classification algorithms for precise predictions.

Key Components: Data analysis, feature engineering, model training with Random Forest, SVC, and SGD, and visualization of insights.
Tools: Python, Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-Learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib
Outcome: Provided insights into wine quality predictors, improving understanding of classification models.

Task 6: Fraud Detection
Description: Developed a fraud detection model using machine learning to identify and prevent fraudulent activities within financial transactions.

Key Components: Anomaly detection, feature engineering, model training with Logistic Regression, and real-time monitoring.
Tools: Python, Scikit-Learn, Numpy, Pandas
Outcome: Built a scalable fraud detection system with predictive capabilities for financial security.
